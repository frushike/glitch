      About 
    </h2>
    <p>Breanne Everett received the Governor General's Innovation Award in 2016 for her work in business and medicine. Through the work of her and her team at  Orpyx, Breanne developed medical technology to help diabetic patients with nerve damage and low blood circulation in their feet. When patients lose feeling in their feet, they are unable to feel when they are injured. If a patient is injured (from stepping on something sharp, for example) it can go unnoticed and untreated, which can lead to infection and sometimes even amputation. </p>
    <p>Breanne's invention is a shoe insert that senses circulation and injury for the patient, and provides feedback through a vest and smartphone or watch. The patient feels vibrations ect through the vest to simulate what they would be feeling through their feet. This product is innovative because it solves a unique problem using technology in a creative way. It is also helping many people with a very real problem that didn't necessarily have a clear solution in the past. </p>
